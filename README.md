# DOM StaticRange

**NOTE: This specification has been MOVED to: https://github.com/w3c/staticrange**


Incubation repo for the `StaticRange` [original proposal](https://github.com/garykac/staticrange/blob/gh-pages/staticrange.md) and preliminary [specification](http://garykac.github.io/staticrange/index.html).

`StaticRange` is a lightweight substitute for `Range`
for use when it is not necessary (or desired) for the range to be updated when the
DOM is mutated.
